# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.6", "3.7", "3.8"]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # setup python
      - uses: "actions/setup-python@v2"
        with:
          python-version: "${{ matrix.python-version }}"
          
      - name: bootstrap
        run: sudo script/bootstrap

      - name: set-up dependency
        run: |
          sudo pip3 install setuptools
          sudo pip3 install conan

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
